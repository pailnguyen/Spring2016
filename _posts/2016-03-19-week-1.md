UPDATE: The [survey link][survey] is now fixed! You no longer need to sign in with a UTMail address.

To the people who were able to show up: thanks for coming out! To the people who weren't able to: you are welcome to talk to me or your peers to get caught up on what was covered.

Please fill out this [survey][survey]! It'll probably take about 20 to 30 minutes, so feel free to put on some classical music. The exercises say that they are due next week; they are actually due on April 8th since we haven't covered loops yet! You should still be able to do Problem 1 with the information that we covered from the slides. If you complete the exercises by April 8th and show up within the first 10 minutes of lecture, I will be happy to look at your code and see if it looks correct and handles my test cases. Feel free to email/talk to me, Farzam, or Eric if you have questions; what I recommend most is talking with your peers. You can email me suggestions, ideas, or candid feedback at paul_nguyen /at/ utexas /dot/ edu. If you are reading ahead, you may also talk to me about any advanced topics.
