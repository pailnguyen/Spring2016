UPDATE: The survey link is now fixed! You no longer need to sign in with a UTMail address.
Please fill out this [survey][survey]! It'll probably take about 20 - 30 minutes, so feel free to put on some classical music. The exercises say that they are due next week; they are actually due on April 8th! Fee free to email/talk to me, Farzam, or Eric if you have questions; what I recommend most is talking with your peers. Feel free to email me suggestions, ideas, or candid feedback at paul_nguyen /at/ utexas /dot/ edu. If you are reading ahead, you may talk to me about any advanced topics.
