For every exercise problem you solve correctly and show it to me/email me it before the deadline for the set (11:59 PM the day the set is due), you will get 2 Paul Points. If you solve a problem correctly but show me/email me it after the deadline, you will get 1 Paul Point. Wrong answers will not be awarded points, but you may resubmit later. You are allowed to collaborate with friends, but you may not copy/paste code from or share source code with friends.

The person/people (stream student or mentor) with the most Paul Points by the end of the mini-course will receive an awesome prize!
