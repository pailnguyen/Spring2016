The latest slides are up; these are the slides shown in Week 3, which was a short lecture. I plan on enhancing these slides in the future since they are not very detailed, but that may take quite a while. We covered [lists and list comprehensions][lists], as well as the basic concept of a stack. We did not cover dictionaries. [Python 3.6][python3.6] is out with a cool new way to format strings! Also, the latest [Windows 10 Insider Preview build][windows] allows you to use many Linux utilities on Windows, which is exciting; I plan to set this up soon.

I'll be unavailable on the 15th, so Farzam will be teaching!

Don't forget to show up to present the stream poster if you signed up for a specific time.
