Exercises 02 is now available under the Exercises tab! You can also click [here][ex02]. The exercises are fairly easy this week! If you have the Miitomo app, you can add me when we meet up on Friday (or at some later time).

Remember that each problem solved correctly will net you 1 Paul Point. In addition, bonus parts/advanced problems will net you 2 Paul Points!
