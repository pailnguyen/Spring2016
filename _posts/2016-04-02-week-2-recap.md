We skipped covering object-oriented programming since I realized it would be better to wait until we have more of a foundation with using functions on a basic level. We covered writing functions useing the `def` keyword, string methods and operations (such as slicing), and `for` loops using both `range()` and with strings, which are immutable sequences of characters. I highly recommend learning more about Python's data model if you want a better idea of what is going on: see [this link][data_model].

Please fill out the [survey][survey] if you haven't already (starting to sound like a broken record...)

For each problem on an exercise set that you complete, you will receive 1 Paul Point! This system was suggested by Rishabh Kothari. The person with the most Paul Points at the end of the mini-course will receive a prize from me. You may email me your solutions or show them to me in class.

The second set of exercises will be up before next Friday and will be due on the 22nd.
